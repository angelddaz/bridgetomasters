If you are looking at this with an html at the end of your URL, I highly recommend checking out the [.md version](https://github.com/angelddaz/bridgetomasters/blob/master/introtoprob.md) instead. Most of the markdown formatting goes out the window in the html site.

Before I start the chapters, I have noticed a lot to do with distributions and densities. I think this [picture](https://github.com/angelddaz/bridgetomasters/blob/master/Py_scripts/misc/dist_framework.PNG) of distribution frameworks will be very helpful:

  <summary> <b> Chapter 1 - Discrete Probability Distributions </b> </summary>
<br>
Discrete basically means a finite number of possibilities within the context of probability.
The more we toss a coin, the more the sample mean approaches "True mean"

1.2 Discrete Probability Distributions
```
the sample space of the experiment is the set of all possible outcomes
```
i.e. Omega = sample space of a 6 sided die = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
if E = 1
P(1) = 1/6 = Probability of rolling a 1 on a 6 sided die

basic set operations picture from the book. Very reminiscent of relational algebra in databases. I guess if we can consider sample spaces as databases of their own in a way.

P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A∩B)
basically the left circle of a venn diagram plus the right circle minus the intersection equals the total area that both circles cover.

Tree Diagrams

definition:
```
The uniform distribution on a sample space Omega containing n elements is the function m defined by
m(ω) = 1 / n, for every ω ∈ Omega.
```

history of probability yay :)
Treating each dice as an independent event in a two dice experiment was a revolution apparently. who knew
by 
```Gerolamo Cardano(1501–1576) in his book Liber de Ludo Aleae```

if an event is favorable three out of four cases, the correct odds is 3 : 1
3/4ths probability is P(.75) and if you get the same success twice in a row, you would do (3/4) * (3/4) instead of squaring both odds, which is what Cardano did mistakenly.

There are two main ways to calculate probabilities according to the end of this chapter:
```
Pascal’s method was to develop an algorithm and use it to
calculate the fair division. This method is easy to implement on a computer and easy
to generalize. Fermat’s method, on the other hand, was to change the problem into
an equivalent problem for which he could use counting or combinatorial methods
```
1. Pascal method of using a generalizable algorithm
2. Fermat method of changing the problem so that we can use counting or combinatorial methods.

I'm not totally sure what the above 10 lines mean but will go into more detail as the book continues.

As a side note, I appreciate that this book has less chapters and more details. Think Stats was great as an intro to multiple topics but since I am familiar with a lot of it, programing and statistics, the parts which I am not familiar with I felt like it didn't go into enough detail. I'm having a good time with Open Intro Stats and this book so far, Intro to Prob. Some books just click and others don't through nobody's fault.
