If you are looking at this with an html at the end of your URL, I highly recommend checking out the [.md version](https://github.com/angelddaz/bridgetomasters/blob/master/introtoprob.md) instead. Most of the markdown formatting goes out the window in the html site.

Before I start the chapters, I have noticed a lot to do with distributions and densities. I think this [picture](https://github.com/angelddaz/bridgetomasters/blob/master/Py_scripts/misc/dist_framework.PNG) of distribution frameworks will be very helpful:

  <summary> <b> Chapter 1 - Discrete Probability Distributions </b> </summary>
<br>
Discrete basically means a finite number of possibilities within the context of probability.
The more we toss a coin, the more the sample mean approaches "True mean"

1.2 Discrete Probability Distributions
```
the sample space of the experiment is the set of all possible outcomes
```
i.e. Omega = sample space of a 6 sided die = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
if E = 1
P(1) = 1/6 = Probability of rolling a 1 on a 6 sided die

basic set operations picture from the book. Very reminiscent of relational algebra in databases. I guess if we can consider sample spaces as databases of their own in a way.

P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A∩B)
basically the left circle of a venn diagram plus the right circle minus the intersection equals the total area that both circles cover.

Tree Diagrams

definition:
```
The uniform distribution on a sample space Omega containing n elements is the function m defined by
m(ω) = 1 / n, for every ω ∈ Omega.
```

left off at pg 40 of the pdf file, not the book. history of probability yay :)
