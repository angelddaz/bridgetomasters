# My Understanding/Condensation of each [Open Intro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os) Chapter

I'm not sure yet how these summaries will go. Probably a mix of blogging and coding about each chapter. I imagine that for the first few books, each intro chapter will be mostly blogging about it and less coding about it. I was debating skipping this book because I have taken statistics, econometrics, etc. in college and have a few years of experience with data analysis. But I ended up deciding I will go through this book.

Now. On to the book!

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to data
A good thing to note. 
```
statistics has three primary components: 
How best can we collect data? 
How should it be analyzed? 
And what can we infer from the analysis?
```
[good video on basics of data analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjif8PTgzUs&list=PLkIselvEzpM6pZ76FD3NoCvvgkj_p-dE8)

```
Guided Practice 1.1
```
Around 20% of the patients in the treatment group had a stroke in the first year.\

I didn't know this:
```
possible values [of a categorical variable such as States or Countries] are called the variableâ€™s levels.
```
or this:
```
Stratified sampling is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. 
The population is divided into groups called strata.
```
[Gah! I always forget which one is right skewed and left skewed](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RxhMS64htGTy-nH8eo8xqYvqT7-yxViVIS_gncWaTwk/edit#slide=id.g1726b84cdb_0_164)
Right skewed has small area under the curve on the right. Left skewed has small area under the curve on the left.

This book is very thorough with lots of videos and slides as supplements within the pdf.
sample mean is xbar

1.6.3 Histograms have always been a little tricky for me. I know that they don't need a Y axis
*binned counts plotted as bars* is a great definition for histograms. Histograms are deceptively simple to me. 

```Histograms provide a view of the data density```
aka distributions
sample variance (s^2) is  ((the sum of ((each observation minus the sample mean) squared) ) divided by sample size minus 1 )

to break **((the sum of ((each observation minus the sample mean) squared) ) divided by sample size minus 1 )** down:

You start with each observation minus the sample mean.
You square each one of these.
You add them all up.
Finally you divide that sum by sample size minus 1.

```The IQR is the length of the box in a box plot. It is computed as IQR = Qsub3 - Qsub1```
