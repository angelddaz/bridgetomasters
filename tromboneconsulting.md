# 3 Parallels Between Statistical Consulting and Trombone Lessons

I follow more than a few statisticians on Twitter.

That may be the most mundane sentence I've ever written.

And something I can count on, are the common gripes about statistical consulting.

I've never consulted of the statistical kind, having gotten a B+ in my Statistics and Probability course, I have never had scientists call me for help on their analyses. But so much of what I read about statistical consulting reminds me of teaching trombone, particularly to younger students around ages 10 - 13. Middle school age. **dun dun duuun**

I loved teaching trombone to middle school students. Young enough to be willing to be silly like a little kid and old enough to get serious when they bought in.

1. Statistical Rigor 

  There's a lot of distance between pedantry/rudeness and enabling lack of rigor.

  As a low brass teacher, Bb (B flat) is the most common note. It's the note that if you pick up for the first time in your life and buzz your lips, blow air, it will most likely come out. It's kind of like home base for trombone so it's very common. In music, there's 12 notes and B (AKA B natural) is one of them. Beginner students will often call Bb (B flat) simply, "B". B is a completely different note, a half step (or piano key) away, and it's technically not correct to call a B flat, "B". 

  Music teachers who don't have much experience or experienced teachers without much patience, immediately pounce on the student, "What are you saying? We are playing B flat not B! There is a difference and if you don't understand that, you are not cut out for music!". I am hyperbolizing a little bit but the sentiment is common. There's a line between being pedantic/rude and enabling/forgiving of any mistake. I learned to say to students, ```"I understand where you're coming from. You haven't been exposed to "B" so you just call "B flat", "B". But as you get better, you will play more music in different keys and I want you to get better. Also as a warning, other teachers may not be so kind, I understand what you were trying to say but other teachers might ignore your intentions."```

  So statistical consulting is quite literally a communications demanding work, being able to balance rigor and compassion. Not everyone knows what the statistician knows, yet the statistician still has to call for excellence and honesty from their client. Much in the same way a music teacher does for a student.

2. Why should I care

  Having a client that doesn't care is the worst. Having an 11 year old blank stare you in the forehead as you explain major scales is the also the worst. Another common complaint I see from statisticians is that clients sometimse don't care to expand their horizons, try the better software (a programming language), or set up good expirement design.

  This again, reminds me of when I taught music. How do I get the 12 year old to care about playing this really dorky instrument, trombone, in an age of rampant insecurity, jadedness, and "Mom said I had to pick something so I chose band"-ness? I'm not sure how a statistician does this but I imagine the best ones motivate clients to care. I can only speak for what I did.

  I made my lessons as fun as possible. Fun was the priority, retainment was secondary. This seems counterintuitive and I don't recommend this for statistical consulting. My reasoning, which I think was correct, was that if I could associate developing music and trombone skills with fun, then I could motivate the student to pick up the instrument out of their own volition before the next lesson. That action of picking up the instrument on their own was absolutely the number one determinant of success. Student ownership and partnership of their success was incredible. Which brings me to my last parallel.

3. Helping others succeed is awesome

  It is amazing to see the sparkle in a student's eye when they finish a passage of music they once thought impossible. The last time I went to a jazz festival, two of my students won awards for their divisions are great bass trombonists. I am still so very proud of them. For all the frustrations that come with dealing with other human beings, whether it's statistical consulting or teaching trombone, it sometimes comes with the greatest joys.
