# Welcome to the Bridge To Data Science / Statistics Masters project

Before I start.
> If you have any questions at any point, please ask. 

> If you would like me to cover something that I haven't covered, please ask. 

> If I ever go too fast, or glaze over something, that I mistakenly assume you know; please call me out

## This website is for people who (but not limited to) :
1. Graduated in the arts, humanities, science, etc. and want to pursue a Data Science (DS) or Statistics (Stats) Masters.
2. Nearing graduation and want to pursue a DS/Stats Masters after graduation for financial purposes
3. Want to have a successful transition into a DS or Stats Masters
4. Don't feel comfortable programming
5. Don't feel comfortable with math and statistics
6. Under-privileged folks who have tried to learn DS on their own but feel like they need a Master's degree (credibility on a resume) to more easily make the leap into a DS job

## This website is made by me! Angel D'az [Twitter](https://twitter.com/angeld_az):
I graduated with a Business and Economic Analytics B.S. and Computer Science minor from Boise State University Fall 2017.
I was a music major for three years before deciding to not do music. I wasn't sure what to do for another two years.
I feel like I scraped by a lot of my math and computer science courses. I also feel like I know ETL, scripting, and databases,
relatively well.

I am currently a database engineer at a startup in Boise. I have no concrete plans of getting a Master's degree in the next few years.
It's one of those things that I figure I will be getting eventually but no set in stone timeline. I am making this for myself but 
also for my brother, who graduated with an Education B.S. and would benefit from this content.

If you can imagine a bridge that takes you from an "unrelated" field such as music to a Data Science Masters degree;
I am probably about 20% of the way on that bridge and want to help you take steps so that you have a successful two years
in graduate school. I will focus on preparing you for a more professional/practical Masters degree rather than a pure math
Statistics degree.

### Topics we will cover (but not limited to):
1. Programming languages such as Python and R
2. How to even get started using these programming languages
3. Fundamental statistics such as; T-tests, linear regression, logistic regression
4. Logistics on admission processes
5. SQL and relational databases
6. Review of calculus problems
7. What to expect in your journey
8. How to apply and prepare for internship interviews
9. The meaning of life
10. Fundamental Linux/Unix shell command line stuff

### Topics we will *probably not* cover:
1. Why Latinx women love The Smiths, 80s British rock group, so much
2. How to get a Data Science job
3. Advanced algorithms and the fine details of them
4. Proofs

### Note: my knowledge of these topics range from
- I barely scraped by my classes
and
- I know this very well and could teach it
