When I taught trombone, I would always ask students what they wanted in their first lessons. So my question for you is what do you want? Assuming you want to switch into a data career from an arts, humanities, or science background; why?

I try to answer these questions for myself in this 11 minute video.

Notes:
* I mention that as a first generation student it can be hard to figure these questions out but I'm not sure if I was clear on that.
* Another motivation I have, that I'm sure many first generation under-represented folks also have, is the want to be able to take care of my parents as they age. Generational wealth is tiny among minorities in the United States so with this in mind, taking care of parents is extremely important to me.
