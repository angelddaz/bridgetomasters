some good encouragement
```
While it is important to know what job is performed by each cog, it
is not necessary to have the skills to construct the machine inside the
box!
```
Easy chapter on purpose.

Fundamentals of inference and predictions. Prediction involves errors and models. Inference is translating those numbers into real world implications - often business questions and needs.

Prediction and inference is denoted as f in this book.

```
Throughout this book, we explore many linear and non-linear approaches
for estimating f
```


**Parametric Methods:**
```
Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach.

First, we make an assumption about the functional form, or shape,
of f. For example, one very simple assumption is that f is linear

After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the
training data to fit or train the model. 

```

There seems to be a trade off between interpretability of a model and flexibility/Accuracy

```
In general, as the flexibility of a method increases, its interpretability decreases.
```

When inference is the main goal, inflexible models which are easy to interpret are probably better. Like OLS regression.
