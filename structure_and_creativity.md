# Structure and Creativity Blog Post

I am a junior data engineer and recent grad in Business Analytics and it took me 7.5 years to graduate. 
The first three years I was a jazz studies major and had jumped deeply into the music world even in high school a few years before that. 
I played trombone in high school and I studied jazz improvisation in college. It was a lot like re-learning my instrument.

If you think of the world’s jobs on a creativity spectrum, jazz musician ranks pretty highly. 
Yet I believe every job, even the most boring drone-like, have opportunities for creativity. 
Unlocking that potential creativity within structure is a hard question to tackle but one that 
I will in terms of data analysis, having lived through developing jazz improvisational skills.

Jazz improvisation is, for the most part, it’s the spontaneous creation of melodic lines on top of a structure of chords and tempo. 
Despite the spontaneity, there is a lot of structure working in the background. Many hours of rehearsal and repetition. 
There is a motto I often heard in the music world that I think is very true; 

### *learn the rules like a master, so that you can break them like an artist.*

Easier said than done. It takes an unusual (in my opinion) amount of patience and resources to learn the rules like a master. 
In data analysis this would be; databases, linear algebra, statistics, probability, algorithms, etc. 

## I will focus on one aspect of improvisation, the harmony. 
I had one main motto when playing/teaching jazz improvisation; there are no wrong notes, 
just notes that range from easy to hard to handle. 

In order to figure out which notes are easy to handle; a music theory primer:

There are 12 notes in Western Music harmony. With this bag of 12 notes, how do we pick out the ones that are easy 
to handle for beginners?

![Chromatic Scale which includes all 12](http://www.musicreadingsavant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/The-Chromatic-Scale1.gif)

Let’s say we are in major key "Do" (pronounced like "Dough") much like generalizing math problems with "n". 
The major scale from the "Do" key is a good starting point to picking "good" sounding notes; 
that will give us 7 out of 12 possible notes.

1. Do
2. Re
3. Mi
4. Fa
5. Sol
6. La
7. Ti
8. Do

The 8th note is a repetition of the first note but an octave higher. *Side note: double the physical wavelength.*

To narrow down our bag of easy notes even further, we use tertian harmony, which Western music is based on. 
This means that every third note stacked on each other will make what we know as major or minor chords. Now we only keep:
1. Do
3. Mi
5. Sol
7. Ti

If we wanted to use only extremely safe notes, I would structure the limits of an improvisational cycle.
1. Do
5. Sol

Which are the first two unique notes in the physical overtone series.

### The universality of physics and music side note:
The funnel from 12 possibly dangerous, to 7 semi safe, to 4 safe, to 2 boring, to even 1 watching paint dry note/s 
comes from the physics of sound waves. I’m no physicist but people around the world will sing in octaves because it 
causes the most harmony between sound waves. People with higher voices sing "Do" up high and people with lower voices sing "Do" down low.


If you wanted to never play a “wrong” note in improvisation; you would just play "Do" the whole time. However, 
monotone improvisation can be super boring to play and to listen to. It would be like only ever using bar charts.

In improvisations, you repeat choruses, or cycles of repeated chord progressions. 
Here’s an example of how I would impose structure while learning and teaching jazz improvisation. 
Each one of these is a chorus, or cycle through the chords, adding up to 4 choruses:

* Only Do - Mi - Sol notes
* Only long notes
* Only short notes
* Anything you want play

## Students often rebelled against this structure. 
They would say they wanted to learn to play however they wanted, 
not realizing that there are rules they needed to learn before they knew how to break them. 
They also said that they would sound cliche or like everybody else, not realizing the many other ways they could 
incorporate themselves into their improvisation. Basically, they would get stuck on the tree of playing two notes, 
for the forest of long-term development. For the most part, they eventually trusted me that I would expand their structures
once they showed mastery in existing ones.

By imposing strict structure, I had one goal: 
## increase focus of the present by lessening the amount of things to juggle.

So how does this all relate to the practice of data analysis/science?

When starting out data analysis, it feels like there’s so much to juggle in your mind. 
Or there can also be full-stack anxiety. So much to learn; Python, R, databases, SQL, GQL, Hadoop, Spark, Data wrangling, etc.
I think it’s best to structure your focus as much as possible without boring yourself.

### What does this all mean for data analysis:

There’s no repeating choruses in data analysis.

However, there are iterations and repetitive data wrangling or analysis processes you can apply the following to. 

## My call to action, is to take a mindful approach to data analysis. 

0. A strong foundation in fundamental theory rules is important because it will allow you to have the best 
judgment in how to structure or focus your analysis at each step.

1. limit yourself to do one thing at a time as well as you can.

  * I am 100 percent guilty to stopping my data wrangling because I'm distracted by an outlier 
and then stopping that because I get distracted by something else. It’s best to finish what you were doing, 
possibly make a note of the distraction to get to it after you are done.

2. Intersperse your work with free-form analysis.

  * No expectations, flow of consciousness type of analysis. Structured work all the time is a bit like living your life like a machine.

3. Take a Bob Ross approach to mistakes.

  * New mistakes are a sign of growth and are a gateway to creativity.

Structure and creativity seemingly two opposite sides of a coin, but I believe that structure in one 
dimension frees you up for creativity in another.
