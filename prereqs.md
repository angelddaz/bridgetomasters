# Pre-requirements. The classes you typically have to take, to get accepted.
> However, they are co-requirements for the material we will be covering. You don't need to have taken any classes to follow along to future videos.

## If you want to save 10 minutes; here are the classes that are commonly required across many programs.

1. Calculus 1 - 3
2. Linear Algebra or Matrix Algebra
3. A programming class or two
4. Statistics and Probability

Depending on your situation, this may be 5 - 9 classes. It's a long road but one worth taking.

Notes: 
* I say in the video that you "have to" take the GRE. Not all programs require this test. I meant to say that you "typically have to take" this test.

* I mention "Experience with R" when looking at Boston University requirements. R is a statistical programming language we will cover later.

* Remember that College Algebra and Trigonometry are pre-requisites to Calculus 1.
