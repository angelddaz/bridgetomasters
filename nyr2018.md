I went to my first conference ever last weekend and it was the New York R conference with about 300 people in Manhattan. I think it would be useful to myself to write about my experiences and possibly useful to other first generation starting professionals of color that might experience some of the things I experienced.

I went to the conference having never met anyone there in person, talked to a few in passing on Twitter but never really getting to know anybody. With the small help of a diversity scholarship, I traveled from Boise to Idaho hoping to see what it is to be around fellow data analysis nerds.

## 10 things I noticed; right or wrong, positive or negative, skewed and biased:
1. At least some in the R community honestly want to do better on diverse representation
2. Most times in the past 3 years (2.7 years as an undergrad) I have been in data, I have felt like pre-fog Rudolph; outside the window looking in. I still felt like that sometimes during the R conference, not sure which circle of people to interrupt to introduce myself in the crowded and loud floor.
3. I think that I would have benefited greatly if I had someone there to be my advocate or someone I could fall back on when I relegated myself to former "Rudolph" state of mind, looking in the window. Something in between constant hand holding, and being completely left alone to sink or swim, would be great support for future diversity scholarship winners.
4. I enjoyed the first day more than the second, having more interpretable datasets and my favorite talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynevery1/"> Brooke Watson </a> on their <a href="https://github.com/brooke-watson/BRRR"> BRRR package </a>  which plays hip hop ad libs in Rstudio.
5. The talks were much more accessible than I expected. Given my terrible experience with BSU Computer Science (CS) classes, I feel much less obligated to take any more CS classes (I have a CS minor) after this conference. The graduate level math, there wasn't much of it, is something I've grown accustomed to not understanding **yet** and being ok with it.
6. I wasn't looking for work but I didn't realize I might have been coming across that way. Calling yourself a "recent grad" is messaging that you're looking for work. Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/brooklynevery1/"> Brooke Watson </a> made me aware of this.
7. I did not see much improvement in terms of Latinx representation inside the conference room from Boise, Idaho. However, outside the conference room, it was amazing. I went in the wrong side of the subway one night, made my way out and couldn't get in the gate on the other side. I think the gate said something like "Recently Used" metro card. A lady soon asked me in Spanish if I needed to get in, and she helped me. That would never happen here in Boise.
8. Computers are super smart and stupid at the same time. Computational contextual errors give data analysts a lot of grief but it's where we serve as bridge builders from data to real world impact.
9. A lot of people were showing the gingham shirt love.
10. The fact that I didn't see myself represented almost at all at the conference (in the most (?) diverse city in the world!!!) goes to show how badly the data science/analyst/statistician community needs my perspective.

Overall, the conference was a positive and worthy experience. However, I wish I would have had someone I knew well that I could treat as a "home-base" when I was spending a lot of time alone. I did stretch my natural shyness/anxiety as much as I could to meet new people and I did meet really kind new people! But still, I spent a lot of time alone staring at circles of people talking loudly.
