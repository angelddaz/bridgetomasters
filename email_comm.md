# Written Communication Tips for First-Gen Students of Color
03/28/2018

### Growing up I only knew mechanics, electricians, roofers, construction workers.
So when I changed to a Business Analytics major, all of a sudden, I was being told I needed an internship in order to be successful. I was a first-generation college student and had zero family or long-time friends in Boise with me. Not only did I not have any experience in professional written communication, I had to send out a lot of emails and ask without leverage or familiarity from people. 

*As a side note - this is why I try to take a nuanced perspective on cold asks. When you don't know anybody in the business you're trying to get into, you have to find and create excuses to meet people. IMO Cold asks get into dangerous territory when what you're asking for is disproportionate to the rapport. People draw that line at different places.*

I had a 1.5 year long search for a paid internship and managed to get 3 over the next 2 years. Most recently, I got a great entry level Support Data Engineer job. I'll be using personal e-mails from my search for an internship as examples. Disclaimer: I run the risk of fixing what ain't broke, for a few reasons: 
1. I am pretty happy with my what I've achieved
2. Earnest unprofessionalism/amateurism can be endearing (not to everybody)

I got the idea of writing this when I was helping my little brother who is in high school, apply for some scholarships. This question "Why are you interested?" kept popping up.

## 1. Be straightforward.
Here's a a warm* intro a professional wrote for me and a local tech CEO.
```
___ceo___,
Angel D’az is a BSU student with an interesting background and 
strong initiative that is very interested in analytics.  
After meeting him, I suspect that he may be a very good match 
for your organization in an intern role.  
Angel has been learning software programming, including R and other 
languages and is actively looking to learn more.

Angel,

___ceo___ is a longtime former colleague of mine and presently the founder 
and CEO of ___company____ focused on _______ solutions.

I’ll let the two of you take it from here.
```
and the email I sent right after in this thread.
```
Hello ________,

I am a junior and a Business and Economic Analytics major with minors in Math and Computer Science. 
I would love to sit down and pick your brain sometime soon.

Thank you,
Angel D'az
```
Here's how I would have worded it now:
```
Hello ________,

I am a Business Analytics student with minors in Math and Computer Science.
Can we meet and discuss a possible internship role at _____(your company)____?

Thank you,
Angel D'az
```
Before this meeting, I was in: *"Let's meet and I won't ask for anything other than your wisdom." mode* Which opened quite a few doors. However, the warm introduction signaled that it was time to switch into: *"I am here to sell." mode* In this scenario, it would have been better to just state the reason I want to meet. It can be disingenious to ignore the real reason you're emailing someone.

## 2. Be concise. Keep your sentences short.
Here's another email from when I was a Finance major, trying to get my foot in the door at a local company by cold-emailing a guest speaker at our finance/accounting club. This was a reply to first contact from this company. The earnestness and long-windedness makes me smile and cringe slightly but in white-collar American culture, conciseness is politeness. I think I was trying to show my excitement as a proxy for passion.

```
Hello ______,

Thank you for contacting me! 
I want to learn more about the world of financial analytics and the day to day duties of an analyst. 
I am currently a Finance B.B.A. major and what drew me to it was the analyst piece of it. 
There is a new degree starting this Fall at the COBE, Business and Economic Analytics B.S., 
and it's very likely I will be switching to that. 
I want to learn more about the humans behind the numbers at _______. 
I also want to learn more about _______ and how they bring value to customers across America. 

I am currently taking 20 units and working 30 hours a week so I would only be able to visit for an hour 
or two a week until spring semester ends on the 2nd week of May. I want a more immersive experience than 
an hour could provide. I was hoping I could visit for a whole day maybe once a week for the summer and 
hopefully pursue a mentoring role if the financial analyst saw fit.

Thank you so much again for contacting me. I very much look forward to learning more at _______.
```

Here's how I would do it now. Without all of the extra information:

```
Hello ______,

I am Boise State Finance student and I am interested in job shadowing at _______ because (1 or 2 short reasons).
I have an overloaded schedule until the end of the semester on May 15.
However, I am flexible to shadow anywhere from an hour to a few hours at your convenience.

Thank you,
Angel
```
## 3. Be confident
I don't have an e-mail example for this one. A tricky and common question is; **why are you interested?**
I think it's good to answer this with the following structure:
```
I am interested in ___specificthingyou'reoffering___ because, (It's a win for me and here's why.) 
Also because, (It's a win for you and here's why.)
```
Remember to be specific when describing the opportunity. It shows that you're not writing boilerplate. It's totally ok to follow templates like the one I just wrote, but the content should be as specific to you as a person as you balance conciseness and straightforwardness.

## 4. Don't be afraid to follow-up
Everyone is busy. Sometimes a short follow-up is welcome but you can't know if you never try.
Here are some guidelines I try to follow when it comes to follow-ups:
1. I usually wait at least two weeks from first contact
2. If there hasn't been a reply after a single follow-up within the same medium (e-mail), I would strongly consider dropping it.
3. Ask within the follow-up that if they know someone who would be better to meet with if they are too busy
4. Multiple medium (e-mail, in-person, Twitter) points of contact **(not all asking)** work so much better to kindly nudge people to respond, than an annoying one-sided conversation *("Hi! Hello?! Notice me! Hi!)* on a single medium.
5. It bears repeating; strongly consider dropping lines of inquiry if you're getting no response after a single follow-up.

## 5. Save templates you like
Here is a great [job pitch template](https://pastebin.com/uAGvD4u9) made by [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/).
Her [pastebin account](https://pastebin.com/u/shurlburt) has lots of great advice and some other templates to steal.

Remember that although the template might not be original, the content within in the template should be specific and original to you.


### Notes:
* *warm means there rapport or familiarity built up ahead of the event*
* *a pitch is a bid or ask*
* *That would make a cold pitch asking a high school friend I haven't talked to in 5 years for a ride to the airport.*
