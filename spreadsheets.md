# Spreadsheets are everywhere in the data world. 

We aren't going to go super deep into them but they're a good starting point because the data is visible while the code is working behind
the scenes. Programming languages that we'll get into soon are the other way around; you see the code and the data is behind the scene.

Spreadsheets are generally frowned upon by more high tech people for several issues that aren't super important right now.

## I think it's more important that, as a beginner into the world of data, you *see* the data and how it can move and change with your clicks and typing.

We'll be working with this transcript dataset for a little bit. It's my grades from Boise State and some transfer credits.
Pretty soon, we'll work with this dataset but with the programming languages that many grad schools want you to know; like R and Python.

[Download the dataset here](./transcript_dataset.csv)

I will upload a video soon of me working with my transcript as a dataset. 
Feel free to download it and poke around before the video is up.

Notes:
* You can use Microsoft Excel or go to [sheets](sheets.google.com) to analyze this dataset
* I am trying to figure out how to make a download button in markdown but for now, you can highlight copy and paste all the cells. That's
kind of a pain. You can also click on the button "Raw" on the top right of the dataset, then right click anywhere on the screen, then
click "Save as..." to save the file on your computer.
