# Spreadsheets are everywhere in the data world. 

We aren't going to go super deep into them but they're a good starting point because the data is visible while the code is working behind
the scenes. Programming languages that we'll get into soon are the other way around; you see the code and the data is behind the scene.

Spreadsheets are generally frowned upon by more high tech people for several issues that aren't super important right now.
There are a lot of people who would recommend starting off the hard way. Just start learning R or Python. I'm more a big tent, slow is good, data practicioner and teacher. It's how I taught music and how I plan to teach data.

## I think it's more important that, as a beginner into the world of data, you *see* the data and how it can move and change with your clicks and typing.

We'll be working with this transcript dataset for a little bit. It's my grades from Boise State and some transfer credits.
Pretty soon, we'll work with this dataset but with the programming languages that many grad schools want you to know; like R and Python.

# Main takeaways:
1. "Real world" data and data analysis is rarely fancier than this. Don't discount beginner training on small datasets as anything but real analysis and real data.
2. Do not try to memorize the spreadsheet formulas we use; (SUMIF, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.)
* The much more important hurdle (than memorizing formulas or functions) is being able to ask the right question in Google or to people who know the programming language/software. It takes a while to get there but you can do it!
3. Bad quality data collection is a lot of times in balance with time, money, or effort.

Notes:
* You can use Microsoft Excel or go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/">Google Sheets</a> to analyze this dataset.
* Excel typically costs money, while a Google account is free, so I will be using Google Sheets in the video.
* Apologies for the bad editing and length of video. I promise it's a good intro into spreadsheets and the process of data analysis though.
* I forget to verbalize the commas inside of the formulas. 
* for example: "=LEFT(A1,2)" should be "EQUALS LEFT OPEN PARANTHESES A1 COMMA 2 CLOSE PARANTHESES"
